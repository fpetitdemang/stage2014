In this paper,
we propose IEPAD, a system that automatically discovers
extraction rules from Web pages. The system can automatically
identify record boundary by repeated pattern mining and multiple
sequence alignment. The discovery of repeated patterns are
realized through a data structure call
PAT trees
.
